\description{
Internal drake function to be called

Users should not need to invoke this function directly.

# This function is meant to be part of Makefile recipes for

# These examples peer into the internals of drake,
# but are not really of practical use for most users.

# Prepare to use a distributed computing parallel backend
# such as "Makefile", "future", or "future_lapply".
